This is a repository to hold latex templates I might readily use for projects.

It includes a script `latex_proj.sh` it is recommended that the template path is editeed if needed then you copy the script in to a location that PATH variable can see as lp `chmod +x ./latex_proj.sh` `mv ./latex_proj.sh ~/.local/bin` 

If you want to add a template, just add it to the directory you clone this in to.
